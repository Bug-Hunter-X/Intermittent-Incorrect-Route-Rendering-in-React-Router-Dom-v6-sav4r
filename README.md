# Intermittent Incorrect Route Rendering in React Router Dom v6

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in React Router Dom v6 where route rendering becomes inconsistent.  Under specific, yet difficult-to-replicate, circumstances the application renders the wrong component for a given URL.  The issue seems related to navigation timing and component lifecycle, but the exact cause remains elusive. This might occur when components unmount and remount quickly, leading to stale state or incorrect route matching.

## Steps to Reproduce

The exact steps to reliably reproduce the bug are currently unknown.  The behavior is sporadic.  This repository provides a basic setup that demonstrates the potential context in which the issue arises.  Further investigation is needed to pinpoint a consistent reproduction sequence.

## Potential Causes

* **Component lifecycle inconsistencies:** The rapid mounting and unmounting of components could lead to data races or stale closures causing incorrect route matching.
* **Timing issues in navigation:**  Asynchronous operations during navigation might interfere with the routing process.
* **Browser caching:**  While less likely, aggressive browser caching could interfere with fresh route rendering.

## Proposed Solution (see bugSolution.js)

This problem requires a deeper understanding of the application's state management and component interactions.  The provided solution explores methods to ensure data consistency and proper synchronization during navigation. This is a potential fix to reduce the occurence of this bug, not a definitive one.
